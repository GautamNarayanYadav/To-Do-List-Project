# To-Do-List-Project
This is To Do List project by Gautam Narayan Yadav.
TODO List are the lists that we generally use to maintain our day to day 
tasks or list of everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks 
at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in
planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks any time and delete a task which is completed.
The four major tasks that we can perform in a TODO list are:

Add tasks
Update tasks
Read tasks
Delete tasks
